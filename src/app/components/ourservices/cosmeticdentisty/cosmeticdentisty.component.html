        Cosmetic dentistry is dentistry aimed at creating a positive change to your teeth and to your smile. Most think of tooth whitening or porcelain veneers, but a cosmetic dentist can provide much more. A skilled, experienced cosmetic dentist can help to improve your appearance, your smile, even your self-esteem and confidence. Today, cosmetic dentistry has continued to evolve to where cosmetic dentists can address functional and aesthetic patient concerns.

       While we all feel we know a beautiful smile when we see one, there is no perfect smile. That’s because each person has a different perception of what is beautiful-you and your cosmetic dentist may even have a difference of opinion. So it’s important that you discover what you really like and then communicate that to your dentist.
