        Oral surgery refers to any surgical procedure performed in or around your mouth and jaw, usually by a dental specialist who’s trained to perform certain kinds of oral surgeries. There are many types of oral surgery, including surgical procedures such as a tooth removal or a root canal. Some oral surgeries involve the repositioning of the jaw. In other instances, oral surgery may involve the removal of a tumor. Oral surgeries might be performed by any one of a number of different kinds of dental specialists, including endodontists, periodontists, and prosthodontists.

      <p style="text-align: center; font-family:cursive"> 
        For tooth and jaw procedures that go beyond the expertise of a general dentist, you might need oral surgery. If your wisdom teeth are impacted, for example, removing them may require you see an oral surgeon. If you suffer from gum disease and have to have a gum graft, you’d be referred to a periodontist who performs those types of oral surgeries. If you require oral surgery, your general dentist will talk to you about it and refer you to the right provider.

        When you have a list of prospective dentists, call or visit several before making an appointment. Ask if he or she a member of organized dentistry (such as ADA or AGD), and find out which dental procedures are completed in-office and which are referred out. Also, ask how far in advance you need to schedule regular checkups or cleanings.
