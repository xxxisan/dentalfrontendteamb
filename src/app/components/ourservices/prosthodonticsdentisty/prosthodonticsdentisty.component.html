      <h3  style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;" ><b>How Prosthodontists Differ From Dentists</b></h3>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-family:cursive"> 
        Prosthodontists focus on highly specific areas of dentistry and restoration, while dentists do all the basics associated with keeping your teeth functional and healthy. A dentist will often refer you to a prosthodontist for work that’s outside general dentistry. Think of the distinction the way you imagine the difference between your family doctor and an orthopaedist.

      <p style="text-align: center;font-family:cursive"> 
        When you have a list of prospective dentists, call or visit several before making an appointment. Ask if he or she a member of organized dentistry (such as ADA or AGD), and find out which dental procedures are completed in-office and which are referred out. Also, ask how far in advance you need to schedule regular checkups or cleanings.
